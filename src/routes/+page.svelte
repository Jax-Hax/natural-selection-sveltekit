			<h1>Natural Selection. How does it work?</h1>
			<p>
				Even biologists don't know the full story, like how did the first self-replicating organism form? But some of it is explainable, and that is what this is for. Whether you are a teacher trying to explain it to kids, or someone just trying to learn, this simple demonstration acts as an interactive way to figure out how evolution works.
